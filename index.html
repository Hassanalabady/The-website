     <h1>Native UK birds!!!!!</h1>
     <p>This list of birds of Great Britain comprises all bird species that have been recorded in a wild state in Great Britain. It follows the official British List, maintained by the British Ornithologists' Union (BOU). Decisions relating to the British List are published by the British Ornithologists' Union Records Committee (BOURC) in its annual reports in the BOU's journal Ibis. These reports were formerly geographically based and included the whole of the British Isles, but records for the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland are now published by their own ornithological associations. Records from the Isle of Man are adjudicated by the Manx Ornithological Society.[2]

        Bird species admitted to the British List are those in BOU categories A, B or C:
        <br><br>
        A: species that have been recorded in an apparently natural state at least once since 1 January 1950.
        <br><br>
        B: species that were recorded in an apparently natural state at least once between 1 January 1800 and 31 December 1949, but have not been recorded subsequently.
        <br><br>
        C: species that, although originally introduced by humans, either deliberately or accidentally, have established breeding populations derived from introduced stock, which maintain themselves without necessary recourse to further introduction.</p>
     <br><br>
     <h2>Nature. Nurture.</h2>
     <P>Our A-Z bird prints are designed to celebrate the beautiful natural world that surrounds us. And we thought it was about time these splendid little characters who play such an important role in our environment, were recognised. 

        Most of the birds featured are British natives, such as the Blue Tit and the Christmas family favourite, the Robin. But some, such as the Cardinal, a US native, and the Fantail, a native New Zealander, add a little bit of colour to the collection.</P>
